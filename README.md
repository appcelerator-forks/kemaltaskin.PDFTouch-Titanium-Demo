PDFTouch Titanium SDK
===

This is a port of the [PDFTouch SDK](http://www.binpress.com/app/pdftouch-sdk-for-ios/859) component which was originally developed for the iOS platform. Now you can use this powerful PDF rendering engine in your **Appcelerator apps** too!

PDFTouch Titanium SDK offers you a solid framework that's easy to use and customize to your needs. With just a couple of lines of code you can create a PDF view controller and present it in your app! The user interface is very similar to the iBooks app and also features a grid display for page thumbnails. For more details please refer to the **Features** section.
